# CAP Training Schedule Generator

An intelligent web application for generating optimized training schedules for underperforming life insurance agents based on CAP (Combined Agent Performance) metrics.

## Overview

This application helps call center managers efficiently schedule training for agents who need performance improvement, while minimizing operational disruption during peak call volume times.

## Features

### üìä Data Analysis
- Upload CSV/TSV files with agent performance data
- Automatic calculation of company-wide average CAP scores
- 50th percentile benchmarking for Close Rate, Annual Premium, and Place Rate
- Intelligent filtering of agents needing training

### üóìÔ∏è Smart Scheduling
- **Location-aware scheduling**: Separate handling for Charlotte (CLT) and Austin (ATX) locations
- **Time zone support**: CLT operates 9-6 EST, ATX operates 8-5 CST
- **Peak hour avoidance**: No training during lunch (12-1 PM) or high-volume periods
- **Site alternation**: Ensures both locations aren't training simultaneously
- **Cohort management**: 2-5 agents per training class for optimal learning

### üìö Targeted Training
- **Monday/Friday**: Zero CAP Score remediation for critical cases
- **Tuesday**: Close Rate training for agents below 50th percentile
- **Wednesday**: Annual Premium training for underperformers
- **Thursday**: Place Rate training for agents needing improvement

### üéØ Key Business Rules
- Agents with tenure ‚â§ 1.9 years are excluded from all calculations
- Zero CAP score agents excluded from average calculations but prioritized for training
- Maximum 5 agents off phones per location per hour
- 95% agent availability maintained during peak hours

### üì± UI Features
- Interactive dashboard with real-time statistics
- Multiple schedule views (Calendar, Location Separation, Manager View)
- Visual warnings for cohorts below minimum size
- Export capabilities (PDF, CSV, Email-ready format)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
