# Lead Attainment Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Lead Attainment adjustment to CAP scores to filter out agents who haven't had sufficient lead volume for fair performance assessment.

## Implementation Details

### Formula
```
Lead Attainment % = min((Leads Per Day / 8) * 100, 100%)
Adjusted CAP Score = Original CAP Score Ã— (Lead Attainment / 100)
```

### Key Changes

#### 1. **Type Definitions** (`types/index.ts`)
- Added `leadsPerDay: number` field
- Added `leadAttainment: number` field (percentage 0-100)
- Added `adjustedCAPScore: number` field

#### 2. **File Parser** (`lib/file-parser.ts`)
- Reads "Leads Per Day" from **Column 10** of TSV file
- Calculates Lead Attainment (capped at 100%)
- Calculates Adjusted CAP Score
- Debug logs show: Original CAP, Leads/Day, Attainment %, and Adjusted CAP

#### 3. **Business Logic** (`lib/business-logic.ts`)
- `calculateStats()`: Uses `adjustedCAPScore` for company average
- `createCohorts()`: Uses `adjustedCAPScore` for eligibility and sorting
- `getTrainingEligibleAgents()`: Uses `adjustedCAPScore` for filtering
- `assignTrainingRecommendations()`: Uses `adjustedCAPScore` for zero CAP detection

#### 4. **Schedule Generator** (`lib/schedule-generator-v4.ts`)
- `getPriorityLevel()`: Uses `adjustedCAPScore` for priority calculation
- All sorting and prioritization uses adjusted scores

#### 5. **UI Components**
- **Stats Dashboard**: Shows "Avg Adjusted CAP" with note "With Lead Attainment"
- **Schedule Display**: Shows both Adjusted CAP (primary) and Original CAP with attainment percentage
  - Format: `Adj CAP: 65 | Orig: 85 | 75% Attain`
- **Manager View**: Shows adjusted scores with original and attainment in tooltip

#### 6. **Export Utilities** (`lib/export-utils.ts`)
- **CSV Export**: Added columns:
  - Adjusted CAP Score
  - Original CAP Score
  - Lead Attainment %
  - Leads Per Day
- **PDF Export**: Shows adjusted score with original and attainment in parentheses

## Impact Examples

| Scenario | Original CAP | Leads/Day | Attainment | **Adjusted CAP** | Outcome |
|----------|-------------|-----------|------------|------------------|---------|
| Full Load Agent | 85 | 10 | 100% | **85** | No change - had full opportunity |
| Light Load Agent | 85 | 4 | 50% | **43** | Adjusted down - small sample size |
| Low Performer, Full Load | 50 | 9 | 100% | **50** | No change - legitimate underperformance |
| Low Performer, Light Load | 50 | 3 | 37.5% | **19** | Heavily adjusted - insufficient data |

## Business Benefits

1. **Fair Assessment**: Agents with low lead volume aren't unfairly flagged for training
2. **Reduced Training Load**: Fewer agents marked as "needing training" due to sample size issues
3. **Data Transparency**: UI shows both original and adjusted scores for complete visibility
4. **Capacity Focus**: Training resources directed toward agents with legitimate performance issues

## Data Requirements

- **Column Index**: Leads Per Day must be in **Column 10** of the TSV file
- **Data Format**: Numeric value (e.g., "5.2", "8.7", "10")
- **Benchmark**: 8 leads per day = 100% attainment (full opportunity)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload TSV file with Leads Per Day column
- [ ] Verify adjusted CAP scores display correctly in Stats Dashboard
- [ ] Check schedule shows agents with adjusted scores
- [ ] Confirm CSV export includes all new columns
- [ ] Test PDF export shows adjusted scores
- [ ] Verify fewer agents marked for training vs. before

## Notes

- **Zero CAP agents** (original CAP = 0) will still have adjusted CAP = 0 regardless of lead volume
- **Metric-specific training** (Close Rate, Annual Premium, Place Rate) still uses 50th percentile logic, but the overall eligibility now factors in adjusted CAP
- All historical calculations (averages, prioritization, sorting) now use adjusted CAP scores
