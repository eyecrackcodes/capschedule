# Enhanced Attendance Tracker Guide

## 🎯 Smart Filtering for Trainers

The new Attendance Tracker uses **intelligent inference** to show you exactly what you need based on:
- Your role (site-specific trainer or manager)
- Today's date and current week
- Session status (pending/attended/no-show)

---

## 📊 Filter Dimensions

### **1. Location Filter**
- **All Sites** - See everything

### **4. Status Filter**
- **All Status** - Everything
- **⏳ Pending** - Not marked yet (default)

- **✗ No-Show** - Already marked as no-show

**Use Case**: Focus on what needs to be done (pending), or review past (attended/no-show)

### **5. Date Range Filter (Smart!)**
