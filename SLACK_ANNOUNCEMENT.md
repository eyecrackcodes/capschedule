# ðŸ“… CAP Training Schedule Update - Smart Scheduling to Minimize Business Impact

Our new training schedule system intelligently staggers sessions to protect operational capacity:

â€¢ **Peak Hour Protection**: Training is strategically scheduled outside our busiest periods (11 AM - 12 PM and 2 PM - 3 PM), ensuring maximum agent availability when call volumes are highest.

â€¢ **Site Alternation**: Charlotte (CLT) and Austin (ATX) locations never train simultaneously - when one site has agents in training, the other maintains full capacity for incoming calls.

â€¢ **5-Agent Maximum**: No more than 5 agents are off the phones at any given time per location, maintaining 95%+ availability even during training hours.

â€¢ **Time Zone Optimization**: Sessions are scheduled within each site's operating hours (CLT: 9-6 EST, ATX: 8-5 CST) with automatic time zone conversion.

**Bottom Line**: This approach ensures continuous coverage across both locations while providing critical performance training to agents who need it most. We're investing in agent development without compromising customer service levels.

The system automatically assigns agents to specific training based on their performance metrics:

- Tuesday: Close Rate improvement
- Wednesday: Annual Premium optimization
- Thursday: Place Rate enhancement
- Monday/Friday: Critical intervention for zero CAP agents

## ðŸ“Š NEW: Metrics & Scheduling Logic Deep Dive

### How We Identify Training Needs

**1. Performance Benchmarking**

- We calculate the 50th percentile (median) for Close Rate, Annual Premium, and Place Rate
- Agents below these benchmarks receive targeted training for their specific weakness
- Example: If 50th percentile Close Rate is 13.1%, agents with <13.1% get Tuesday training

**2. Smart Prioritization**

- **Critical**: Zero CAP agents â†’ Immediate Monday/Friday intervention
- **High Priority**: 20+ points below average CAP â†’ First scheduling slots
- **Medium Priority**: 10-19 points below average â†’ Standard scheduling
- **Targeted Training**: Above average CAP but weak in specific metric â†’ Day-specific training

**3. Cohort Intelligence**

- Minimum 2 agents per class (peer learning)
- Maximum 5 agents per class (personalized attention)
- Mixed Performance/Standard tiers when possible
- Location-based grouping to maintain site culture

### The Algorithm Behind the Schedule

**Time Slot Strategy**:

```
BEST TIMES (High Priority):
â€¢ 8-9 AM CST / 9-10 AM EST - Pre-peak productivity
â€¢ 2-3 PM CST / 3-4 PM EST - Post-lunch recovery

GOOD TIMES (Medium Priority):
â€¢ 9-10 AM CST / 10-11 AM EST - Morning ramp-up
â€¢ 3-4 PM CST / 4-5 PM EST - Afternoon wind-down

ACCEPTABLE TIMES (Low Priority):
â€¢ 10-11 AM CST / 11 AM-12 PM EST - Near peak
â€¢ 4-5 PM CST / 5-6 PM EST - End of day
```

**Site Alternation Logic**:

1. System checks which location was scheduled last
2. Attempts to schedule opposite location next
3. If not possible, proceeds but flags for review
4. Result: One site always at 100% capacity

### Business Impact Metrics

- **Service Level**: 95%+ availability maintained
- **Training Coverage**: 100% of underperformers scheduled within 2 weeks
- **Operational Risk**: Zero simultaneous site outages
- **ROI**: Targeted training = faster improvement
