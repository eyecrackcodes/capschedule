# Bottom Quartile Training System - Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ New Training Logic (25th Percentile)

### **Major Changes on `feature/bottom-quartile-training` Branch**

**1. Metric-Specific Training: 50th â†’ 25th Percentile**
- Only agents in the **bottom 25%** (worst quarter) of each metric get targeted training
- Much more selective than previous 50% threshold
- Creates smaller, more focused training groups

**2. Cohort Size: 5 â†’ 3 Agents Maximum**
- All training cohorts capped at **3 agents**
- Ensures intimate, personalized coaching sessions
- Better trainer-to-agent ratio

**3. Peak Hours Excluded**
- Removed 10:30-11:30 AM CST time slot
- Avoids 11:00 AM - 2:00 PM CST peak call volume period
- Only schedules during proven low-volume times

**4. Attendance Stats Fix**
- Stats cards now calculate from ALL assignments (not filtered subset)
- Attended/No-Show counts update correctly in real-time
- Filter selections only affect session display, not totals
